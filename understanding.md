Yes, you're absolutely right — all of the ones you've listed are **middlewares** in Express. Here's a clearer and more organized table confirming that:

---

### ✅ Express Middlewares You Listed

| **Middleware**             | **Purpose**                                           | **Applies To**                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.json()`           | Parses JSON bodies and populates `req.body`           | Requests with `Content-Type: application/json`                  |
| `express.urlencoded()`     | Parses URL-encoded form data and populates `req.body` | Requests with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` |
| `express.static("Public")` | Serves static files like images, CSS, JS, etc.        | Any request to a matching file path in `Public/`                |
| `cookieParser()`           | Parses cookies and adds them to `req.cookies`         | Any request that includes a `Cookie` header                     |

### ✅ Bonus: Type of Each Middleware

| Middleware             | Built-in or External                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.json()`       | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `express.urlencoded()` | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `express.static()`     | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `cookieParser()`       | ❗ External (requires `npm install cookie-parser`) |

So yes, these are all **middleware functions** that prepare and process parts of the HTTP request before it reaches your actual route logic.

Let me know if you want a visual breakdown or explanation of when each one kicks in during a request.
