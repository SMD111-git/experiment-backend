Yes, you're absolutely right — all of the ones you've listed are **middlewares** in Express. Here's a clearer and more organized table confirming that:

---

### ✅ Express Middlewares You Listed

| **Middleware**             | **Purpose**                                           | **Applies To**                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.json()`           | Parses JSON bodies and populates `req.body`           | Requests with `Content-Type: application/json`                  |
| `express.urlencoded()`     | Parses URL-encoded form data and populates `req.body` | Requests with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` |
| `express.static("Public")` | Serves static files like images, CSS, JS, etc.        | Any request to a matching file path in `Public/`                |
| `cookieParser()`           | Parses cookies and adds them to `req.cookies`         | Any request that includes a `Cookie` header                     |

---

### ✅ Bonus: Type of Each Middleware

| Middleware             | Built-in or External                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.json()`       | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `express.urlencoded()` | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `express.static()`     | ✅ Built-in to Express                             |
| `cookieParser()`       | ❗ External (requires `npm install cookie-parser`) |

---

So yes, these are all **middleware functions** that prepare and process parts of the HTTP request before it reaches your actual route logic.

Great question — you're looking at a way to set how **long a cookie should live** before it expires.

---

### 🍪 `maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`

This sets the **cookie expiration time** in **milliseconds**. Let's break it down:

---

### 🔢 What does the math mean?

```js
7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
```

* `7` → 7 days
* `24` → 24 hours in a day
* `60` → 60 minutes in an hour
* `60` → 60 seconds in a minute
* `1000` → 1000 milliseconds in a second

---

### 🕒 Total result:

```js
7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 = 604800000 milliseconds
```

So, **`maxAge: 604800000`** means the cookie will last for **7 days** before expiring.

---

### ✅ Why use `maxAge`?

* It's used to tell the browser: **"Store this cookie for X amount of time."**
* After that time, the browser automatically deletes it.

---

### 🧠 Tip:

If you want to set a specific expiration **date** instead of a duration, you can use `expires`:

```js
res.cookie("token", token, {
  expires: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // same as maxAge, but with an exact timestamp
});
```

But usually, `maxAge` is simpler and more common for duration-based cookies.

Great — you're asking about this syntax:

```js
decoded?._id
```

Let’s explain this clearly.

---

### 🧠 This is called **optional chaining** in JavaScript.

It’s a safe way to **access a property** on an object **without causing an error** if that object is `undefined` or `null`.

---

### ✅ What it means:

```js
decoded?._id
```

is the same as saying:

```js
if (decoded !== undefined && decoded !== null) {
    return decoded._id;
} else {
    return undefined;
}
```

So:

* If `decoded` exists: it returns `decoded._id`
* If `decoded` is `undefined` or `null`: it **doesn't crash**, it just returns `undefined`

---

### 🤔 Why use it?

Let’s say you're decoding a JWT like this:

```js
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
```

And then later:

```js
const userId = decoded?._id;
```

If for some reason `decoded` failed or is `undefined`, this will **not throw an error** — it will just return `undefined`.

---

### ❌ Without optional chaining:

```js
const userId = decoded._id; // ❗️If decoded is undefined → ❌ TypeError: Cannot read property '_id' of undefined
```

---

### ✅ With optional chaining:

```js
const userId = decoded?._id; // ✅ No crash; just gives undefined
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR:

| Code           | Safe? | Returns                           |
| -------------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| `decoded._id`  | ❌ No  | Crashes if `decoded` is undefined |
| `decoded?._id` | ✅ Yes | Returns `undefined` safely        |
